      question: 'What is the difference between blood and plasma donation?',
      answer: 'Blood donation collects whole blood which contains red cells, plasma, and platelets. Plasma donation collects only the liquid part of your blood (plasma) through a process called plasmapheresis. The remaining blood components are returned to your body. Plasma donations take longer but can be done more frequently.'

      question: 'Can I donate if I have a tattoo or piercing?',
      answer: 'Yes, you can donate blood if you have a tattoo or piercing, but you need to wait a certain period. For tattoos, you must wait 3-6 months depending on your location and whether it was done in a licensed facility. For piercings, the waiting period is typically 3 months. These rules help ensure your safety and the safety of blood recipients.'
